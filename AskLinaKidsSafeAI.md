# AskLina
This app is designed to act as a voice-based AI buddy that young children can interact with safely. The idea came from my experience as a mom - I saw how often kids ask questions (hundreds a day!) and how hard it can be for busy parents to answer every single one patiently. The AI acts as a safe, encouraging, and age-appropriate companion that can answer their questions, tell stories, and suggest fun parent-child bonding activities based on the conversation.
